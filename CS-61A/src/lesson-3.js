/*
 * Essentials of interpretation.
 * by Dmitry A. Soshnikov <dmitry.soshnikov@gmail.com>
 *
 * Lesson 3. Parsing. Parser of AE in math infix notation.
 *
 * In this lesson we continue the implementation of our parser
 * started in lesson 2 where we wrote the first part of the parsing
 * process -- the lexer (or scanner, tokenizer).
 *
 * The work of the parser is similar to that of the lexer. The
 * difference is that the parser works with higher abstractions
 * known as "tokens" (which are already provided by the lexer). That is,
 * the lexer builds tokens from chars, and the parser builds semantic nodes
 * from tokens. On the return from the parser we should already get
 * the complete AST in a format that is understandable for
 * our interpreter.
 *
 * Source -> Lexer -> Parser -> Interpreter, e.g.:
 *
 * "1 + 2" -> ["1", "+", "2"] -> ["+", "1", "2"] -> 3
 *
 * We assume here an interpreter supporting multiplication
 * and division (exercise 1 from lesson 1) to take
 * precedence into account.
 * For example 2 + 2 * 2 should be 6 (by the school math ;)), not 8,
 * if we hadn't consider the precedence. On the other hand,
 * (2 + 2) * 2 should be 8, since grouping operator has the highest priority.
 *
 * Dependencies for this lesson:
 *   1. Improved "evaluate" function (with * and /) from lesson 1
 *   2. Lexer constructor from lesson 2
 *
 * So let's start with the parser.
 *

     * -- Working with precedence -----
     *
     * As was mentioned, multiplication and division have higher
     * priority than addition and subtraction: 2 + 2 * 2 == 6.
     * It means that the first action in our expression parsing
     * should be exactly parsing of the multiplication and only after
     * that -- applying the result to addition. With respect to
     * procedure execution order it means the we should first
     * start parsing the addition (let's call it additiveExpression),
     * and then, already inside it, to parse its LHS and RHS operands as
     * multiplicativeExpression.
     *
     * LHS and RHS refer to Left/Right Hand Side
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * additiveExpression: LHS + RHS -> 2 + 2 * 2, where:
     * LHS - "2", RHS - "2 * 2". So, we parse both RHS and LHS of the
     * additiveExpression as multiplicativeExpression.
     *
     * Besides the additiveExpression can contain only RHS assuming LHS
     * is 0. For example: 2 * 2 is 2 * 2 + 0.

    // So the parseExpressionsRecursively is just a wrapper

    // part, i.e. *the lowest* precedence.
    //
    // As we'll see the grouping operator has the *highest* priority:
    // (2 + 2) * 2 is 8. That's why grouping operators are parsed at the end.
    // I.e. the rule is: the lowest precedence nodes are parsed first,
    // and the highest precedence nodes -- last.

// This is the only and the last parser we've written in this
// series. You may find more complete example of parsing of
// a small language e.g. in this article (we used a similar format):
// http://blog.tcx.be/2007/05/writing-parser-overview.html
//
// That said, the process of the interpretation isn't directly
// related to the process of parsing. In the next lessons we'll
// continue to work with ASTs only as our programs, though you may
// write your own parsers from *any* concrete syntax to our AST format.
//
// The parser we've written is known as top-down LL parser.
// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_parsing
// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser
//
// We also see that the parsing process is actually laborious process and
// in practice you may want to consider automatic parser generators, such
// as e.g. Jison for JavaScript (see: http://zaach.github.com/jison/). Though,
// hand-written parsers usually give us the ability to control the source
// more effectively and in more human view, showing sensible parse errors.
//
// In fact, we could directly interpret the results when parsing
// the nodes. However, we underline here, that the parsing process is the
// *intermediate* stage -- before the AST format, and exactly the
// parser allows us to have *different concrete syntaxes* for the *same semantics*.

// Exercises:
//
// 1. parseAdditiveExpression and parseMultiplicativeExpression are
//    very similar. Can we reuse the code making a more compact
//    method? Won't it decrease the readability?
//
// 2. Implement unary "+" and "-" which invert the sign of the numbers.
//
//    Example: evaluate("-2 + 3") -> 1
//
// 3. Experiment with other concrete syntaxes which will compile
//    to the same AST format which we use in the "evaluate" function.
//    Both Lexer and Parser should be corrected in this case.
